                <li>&quot;It’s also odd to some lawyers that generative AI firms
                    are being sued and not those that compiled the dataset. In
                    the case of Midjourney, that would be the large-scale
                    Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION), based in
                    Germany. “If LAION created the dataset, then the alleged
                    infringement occurred at that point, not once the dataset
                    was used to train the models,” Eliana Torres, an
                    intellectual property lawyer with the law firm Nixon

            <p><strong>What are the limitations of AI?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>currently a slight learning curve</li>
                <li>big compute needed to make new models</li>
                <li>AI doesn&#39;t have knowledge yet</li>
                <li>Images relatively low resolution</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>How long will these limitations exist?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not that long, the year over year, and even month over month
                    improvements are staggering.</li>
                <li>Google&#39;s new Muse AI image generator just sped up its
                    text to image generation by a factor of 10, now takes about
                    a second an image, eventually will be faster than realtime -

            <p>Can we eliminate bias in AI?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Given that fairness is subjective (even mathematically), how do

    <h2 id="-8-31-ai-and-manipulation">~8:31 - AI and Manipulation</h2>
    <p>(3 Questions-approximately 3 minutes per question)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>How effective is AI at manipulation (politics
                    etc)?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html">The
                        People Onscreen Are Fake. The Disinformation Is
                        Real.</a> - New York Times article about state actors
                    creating deepfakes to spread misinformation</li>
                <li>Tom Cruise example - needed a body double and voice actor
                    but now could be more easily done</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Who should be held responsible?</strong> - The software
                is already available and open source, ultimately the actors are
                responsible. For state actors sanctions and diplomacy and
                deterrence will likely be the unfortunate solution as with
                nuclear weapons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Can we identify manipulative AI (deepfakes etc)?</strong>
                - for now yes. It will not be long until the detection takes
                much longer than a campaign cycle. Eventually it will likely be
                almost undetectable without massive compute power.</p>

    <p>~9:15 — What is the future of AI and Ethics?</p>

                Filing</a>
            <ul>
                <li>&quot;Stability downloaded or otherwise acquired copies of
                    billions of copyrighted images without permission to create
                    Stable Diffusion,&quot; - This could easily be circumvented
                    by having the AI look as a screen of images via a camera
                    without ever copying the images.</li>
                <li>&quot;Ultimately, it is merely a complex collage tool.&quot;
                    - Collage can already be protected by fair use.</li>
                <li>&quot;By training Stable Diffusion on the Training Images,
                    Stability caused those images to be stored at and
                    incorporated into Stable Diffusion as compressed copies.
                    Stability made them without the consent of the artists and
                    without compensating any of those artists.&quot; -
                    Misunderstanding of the diffusion process and compression
                </li>
                <li>&quot;All AI Image Products operate in substantially the
                    same way and store and incorporate countless copyrighted
                    images as Training Images.&quot; - They are not copying the
                    images or storing them.</li>
                <li>The best argument is the financial harm to the artist when
                    typing a name in gets a style. This could be avoided by
                    removing names from the training set or prompts.</li>
                <li>The lawsuits are going to have a tough hill to climb and
                    then they will have to litigate the next technology</li>
                <li>&quot;The resulting image is necessarily a derivative work,
                    because it is generated exclusively from a combination of
                    the conditioning data and the latent images, all of which
                    are copies of copyrighted images. It is, in short, a
                    21st-century collage tool.&quot; p20 again - not all the
                    images in the training are copyrighted so this is going to
                    be a hard line of argument</li>
